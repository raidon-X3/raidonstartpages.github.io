# Startpage Emporium
A curated list of startpages for your browser.<br />Est. Jan 2016<br /><br />
# hey quick note!
this isnt the actual startpages repo. this is my fork that im using for personal use and is forked so that i can edit some startpages. <br />
you can use it and are welcome to use it but i coded it with only what i want in mind.<br />
oh and also it does not work without downloading the whole repo and running it locally because i dont actually really know how to code in js.<br />
oh and also also i deleted everything i wont use for storage lol (is it obvious this is meant for me and me only?)<br /><br />
### Features
